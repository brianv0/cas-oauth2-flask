    mvn clean package jetty:run

To test, you can call a protected url by clicking on the "Protected url by **xxx**" link, which will start the authentication process with the **xxx** provider.  
Or you can click on the "Authenticate with **xxx**" link to manually start the authentication process with the **xxx** provider.
